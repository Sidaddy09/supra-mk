        <p>
            The Toyota Supra MK4, also known as the A80 Supra, was produced from 1993 to 2002. It is one of the most iconic sports cars ever built. The MK4 Supra was powered by a 2JZ-GTE inline-six engine, which is renowned for its ability to handle high levels of modification and produce significant horsepower. It gained fame in the "The Fast and the Furious" movie franchise and is still a sought-after car by enthusiasts worldwide.

            The Toyota Supra MK5, also known as the A90 Supra, made a comeback in 2019 after a long hiatus. It was developed in collaboration with BMW and shares some components with the BMW Z4. The MK5 Supra is powered by a turbocharged inline-six engine and has modern features and performance enhancements. It has received both praise and criticism for its departure from the previous Supra generations, but it continues to be a symbol of Toyota's sports car heritage.
